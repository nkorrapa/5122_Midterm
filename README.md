# Shots Allowed

## Introduction
This is a visualization showing where NHL teams allow their opponents to take shots on their goaltender during the 2022-2023 regular season.

## The Data

The data was scraped from the NHL play-by-play api. The data was then pared down to around 30 relevant data fields from the initial 110. After that, the positional data was then manipulated to meet the needs of the visualization.

## Future Work

There is some future work planned. Future updates include the ability to compare two teams and the ability to compare two individual goaltenders.
